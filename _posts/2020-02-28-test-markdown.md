GEOG 728 Geospatial Analysis and Programming in R is an advanced studio course on geospatial data analysis and modeling using R offered every other spring at Kansas State University.  This is the public-facing website for the course where information and materials can be examined by folks that are not member of the class student body. Tutorials, lecture materials, and lab assignments created by Dr. Nelson and prior GEOG 728 students are openly shared here for your use in the Resources tab.
