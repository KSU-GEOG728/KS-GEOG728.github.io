GEOG 728 Geospatial Analysis and Programming in R is an advanced studio course on geospatial data analysis and modeling using R offered every other spring at Kansas State University.  In the course students learn how to manipulate and display spatial data, describe and summarize spatial data characteristics, explore patterns and relationships in spatial data, and conduct reproducible research using R. The course helps students to develop technical skills in programming and data analysis (with specific emphasis on spatial data wrangling) and soft skills related to independent problem-solving and trouble-shooting.


## Course Topics and Format

The course is roughly divided into four primary topics:

1. Introduction to R, data wrangling, and data visualization in R

2. Working with vector data in R

3. Working with raster data in R

4. Pattern analysis and spatial modeling in R

I use a “flipped” classroom format such that I will expect each student to have completed the readings and associated tutorial activities prior to class. In my experience programming is a skill that is best learned by doing. As such, class meetings will focus more on doing data analyses in R than on me telling you how to do data analysis in R. During class we will live code and work through spatial data analysis examples together and I will provide assistance on lab assignments and final projects.

## Prerequisites

There are no hard prerequisites for the course, however **a basic understanding of statistics and spatial analysis is expected**. Previous experience with programming (Python, Javascript, C, etc.) and/or geographic information system software (i.e.ArcGIS, QGIS) is a plus.

## Resources

In keeping with working with an open source tool there is no required textbook for this class. Instead we will make use of the following free open source resources:

[Cookbook for R](Links to an external site.)
[YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R](Links to an external site.)
[R for Data Science]( Links to an external site.)
[Spatial Data Science with R]( Links to an external site.)
[Intro to GIS and Spatial Analysis]( Links to an external site.)

While lab computers are available to students in the class, access is limited due to extensive use of the lab by other classes for instruction. Access to a personal computer (PC preferred) and at least 1 GB of storage space (on a USB drive or cloud storage service) is strongly reccommended.
